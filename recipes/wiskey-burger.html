    <h2>The Wiskey Burger, America's favorite junk food!</h2>
    <p>Whiskey Burgers are hamburger patties that are soaked in whiskey and garlic. Seriously! Soaked in Whiskey and garlic! 
       This recipe got my husband home early for dinner. It's a game changer for burger night.</p>
    
    <h3>INGREDIANTS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (85% lean recommended)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons avocado oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sea salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup whiskey</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>STEPS:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wet your hands, and form 2 (8-ounce) burgers; place on a plate, cover, and refrigerate until ready to grill. For this process, cold meat works best.</li>
            <li>Before starting the triple-searing process, build a very hot hardwood charcoal fire. Oak, mesquite or hickory are great choices. 
                The coals should be glowing red, and radiating extreme heat before the meat hits the grill.</li>
            <li>Rub burgers all over with oil. Coat with sea salt until entire surface area is completely covered.</li>
            <li>Pour whiskey into a shallow bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Place burgers on hottest spot on the grill, and sear both sides, 2 minutes per side.</li>
            
        </ol>
